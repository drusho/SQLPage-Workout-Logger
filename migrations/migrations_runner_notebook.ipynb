    "# Database Migration Runner\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filename:** `migrations/migration_runner_notebook.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** This notebook provides a safe and reliable way to apply schema changes to the `workouts.db` database. \\\n",
    "It automates the process of backing up the database, applying new SQL migration scripts, and tracking which scripts have \\\n",
    " already been run to prevent accidental re-runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "This notebook is the final step in the migration process. It is designed to run `.sql` files that you create in the \\\n",
    "`migrations` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Workflow\n",
    "**1. Create a Migration File:**\n",
    "- First, create your migration logic in a new `.sql` file inside the `migrations/` directory.\n",
    "- Use the `000_migration_template.sql` as a starting point.\n",
    "- Name your file sequentially (e.g., `006_add_new_feature.sql`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Run This Notebook**\n",
    "- Once your `.sql` file is ready, open this notebook (`migration_runner_notebook.ipynb`).\n",
    "- Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom.\n",
    "- The script will automatically find your new `.sql` file, back up the database, and execute the migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Automated Backups:** Creates a timestamped backup in the `../backups/` folder before any changes are made.\n",
    "- **Idempotent:** The script keeps track of applied migrations in a `_migrations table`, so it will never run the \\\n",
    "same script twice.\n",
    "- **Transactional:** Each migration is wrapped in a transaction. If any part of a script fails, the entire change is \\\n",
    "automatically rolled back, leaving your database in a clean state."
