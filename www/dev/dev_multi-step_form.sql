/**
 * @filename      dev_multi-step_form.sql
 * @description   A development and testing script that demonstrates how to build a complex,
 * multi-step form in SQLPage. This code is based on an official SQLPage
 * example for booking a flight and is not integrated with the main
 * workout logger application.
 * @created       2025-06-15
 * @last-updated  2025-06-15
 * @requires      - The 'example' table (for the dynamic shell component).
 * @returns       A complex, multi-step `form` component that conditionally displays fields
 * for booking a flight based on user input from previous steps.
 * @see           - Official Example: https://sql-page.com/examples/multistep-form/
 * @see           - GitHub Source: https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/blob/main/examples/official-site/examples/multistep-form/result.sql
 * @note          This is a developer tool for testing and is not part of the main application.
 * It creates its own temporary `cities` table. The initial `dynamic`
 * component may fail if the `example` table does not exist.

-- # SQLPage Multi-Step Form Example

-- The example below demonstrates how to build complex multi-step forms using the [form](/documentation.sql?component=form#component) component.
-- In this example, the list of cities is taken from a dynamic database table,
-- and each step of the form is shown conditionally based on the previous step.
-- The form has a variable number of fields: after the number of adults and children are selected,
-- a field is shown for each passenger to enter their name.

-- See [the SQL source on GitHub](https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/blob/main/examples/official-site/examples/multistep-form) for the full code.
