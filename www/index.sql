/**
 * @filename      index.sql
 * @description   The main application dashboard and a dynamic, multi-step, single-page interface for logging workouts. 
 It uses a progressive disclosure UI where components appear as the user makes selections.
 * @created       2025-06-14
 * @last-updated  2025-06-19
 * @requires      - layouts/layout_main.sql: Provides the main UI shell and handles user authentication.
 * @requires      - UserExerciseProgressionTargets (view): Used to fetch the target sets, reps, and weight for a user's current progression.
 * @requires      - WorkoutTemplateDetails (view): Used to populate the list of exercises for a given workout template.
 * @requires      - WorkoutLog, WorkoutSetLog (tables): Queried to display the user's last performance for a selected exercise.
 * @param         template_id [url, optional] Controls which workout's exercises are displayed. Set by the form in Step 3.
 * @param         selected_exercise_id [url, optional] Controls which exercise's logging form is displayed. Set by the form in Step 5.
 * @param         success [url, optional] A flag that triggers the display of the "Workout Saved!" alert.
 * @returns       A full UI page that progressively reveals more components as the user makes selections.
 * @see           - /actions/action_save_workout.sql: The script that the main workout logging form submits to.
 * @note          The page state is managed via URL parameters. Forms are set to 'auto_submit' to reload the page and reveal the next step in the workflow.
